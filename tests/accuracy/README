Check the cycle-by-cycle accuracy of MacSim and VHDL model

First the binaries for a specific architecture must be build using

    make -f <script>.mk clean all

Available build scripts are:

    pnoo.mk:    RV64I, one-to-one with implicit flow control

The binaries are put into build/. The sources are from rcmc/sw/tests/ and
rcmc/sw/benchmarks/.

To compare all compiled binaries use

    ./cmp_multiple.sh <core name> <noc width> <workdir> <RISC-V ELF files ...>"

core name: directory within /rcmc/fpga with the VHDL processor model
noc witdh: n for a NoC with n x n nodes
workdir:   a directory name to allow parallel execution






make
-------------------
Compile benchmarks for the FPGA to build/. The sources are from rcmc/sw/tests/ and
rcmc/sw/benchmarks/
ARCH= must be given for the ISA.


cmp.sh
----------
Simulate an ELF file with MacSim and GHDL and compare the execution.
Different working directories are possible to allow parallel execution.
Prerequisites: MacSim and shexdump must be build and GHDL installed.



cmp_multiple.sh
---------------
Compare all ELF files given as arguments in the command line
