Check the cycle-by-cycle accuracy of MacSim and VHDL model

Usage:

make
-------------------
Compile benchmarks for the FPGA to build/. The sources are from rcmc/sw/tests/ and
rcmc/sw/benchmarks/
ARCH= must be given for the ISA.


cmp.sh
----------
Simulate an ELF file with MacSim and GHDL and compare the execution.
Different working directories are possible to allow parallel execution.
Prerequisites: MacSim and shexdump must be build and GHDL installed.



cmp_multiple.sh
---------------
Compare all ELF files given as arguments in the command line
