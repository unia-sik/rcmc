/*
 *    FUNCTION RANDLC (X, A)
 *
 *  This routine returns a uniform pseudorandom double precision number in the
 *  range (0, 1) by using the linear congruential generator
 *
 *  x_{k+1} = a x_k  (mod 2^46)
 *
 *  where 0 < x_k < 2^46 and 0 < a < 2^46.  This scheme generates 2^44 numbers
 *  before repeating.  The argument A is the same as 'a' in the above formula,
 *  and X is the same as x_0.  A and X must be odd double precision integers
 *  in the range (1, 2^46).  The returned value RANDLC is normalized to be
 *  between 0 and 1, i.e. RANDLC = 2^(-46) * x_1.  X is updated to contain
 *  the new seed x_1, so that subsequent calls to RANDLC using the same
 *  arguments will generate a continuous sequence.
 *
 *  This routine should produce the same results on any computer with at least
 *  48 mantissa bits in double precision floating point data.  On Cray systems,
 *  double precision should be disabled.

 *     IMPLICIT DOUBLE PRECISION (A-H, O-Z)
 *     SAVE KS, R23, R46, T23, T46
 *     DATA KS/0/
 *
 *  If this is the first call to RANDLC, compute R23 = 2 ^ -23, R46 = 2 ^ -46,
 *  T23 = 2 ^ 23, and T46 = 2 ^ 46.  These are computed in loops, rather than
 *  by merely using the ** operator, in order to insure that the results are
 *  exact on all systems.  This code assumes that 0.5D0 is represented exactly.
